<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:24.0pt;line-height:200%'>An Unexpected Offer</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“Sasha,
is that you?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“Yeah.”
She stepped into the light and smiled, “it’s me.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“I—,”
Michael tilted his head towards the sky and sighed heavily before looking back
down. “I’m sorry. I know what I did was wrong but,” he wiped at his eyes,
sniffed, “but I just wanted to tell you that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Sasha
nodded, “I know Dad.” She stepped forward and pulled him into a hug. “I forgive
you.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Michael
expelled a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. Just then he heard a s
loud tearing sound coming from above. He looked up and found a tear in the sky.
Through it you could see a city made of marble and gold, beings crowded the golden,
ragged edges of the tear, looking down on the world below through the sides of
their eyes crinkled in laughter. The crowd made space as two of them, descended
amid soft songs, large wings of white feathers flapping behind them. They were
clad in simple white robes and sandals with laces that wound up and around
their ankles. One carried an open book in one hand and a golden quill in the other.
The other had his arms stretched wide open, a reassuring smile that made him
easily the most beautiful person in the universe. “Sasha,” he said, voice calm
and clear like a gentle breeze, yet commanding. “Welcome home.” The being
engulfed Sasha in his arms. Tears rand down Sasha’s cheeks and she closed her
eyes as a light bathed onto the pair from the tear above. Her bloodied clothes faded
from existence, being replaced with a flowing white satin like that of the
pair. The dirt and grime that coated her skin was cleaned, revealing smooth,
sable skin. Her thick, matted hair had turned into a mass of kinky curls on her
head, adorned with a halo. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Sasha
opened her eyes and unfurled her wings. She looked at her father and smiled. “Goodbye
Dad.” She lifted herself off the ground and followed the two beings through the
tear in the sky. As the beings around the edges applauded her entrance, the
tear closed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Michael’s
eyes stayed glued to where the tear had been, the image of his daughter’s
ascension fresh in his mind. His trance was broken by a loud crack, he scanned
the skies and frowned. “There’s nothing up there.” He felt a hot gust of wind
from below and his eyes widened. He lowered his head and cursed under his
breath. The ground beneath him opened to reveal a land of darkness and fire.
The new beings that appeared at the edge of the tear were clad in various armor
brandishing weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“For
your crime—” A deep, menacing voice boomed as two armored beings clawed their
way upward, stabbing their brethren and tossing them below to peals of dark
laughter. “of killing your kin.” Michael felt his heart throbbing in his
throat, his eyes glued to one being his armor was brass with tortured faces
etched onto the metal, he carried a barbed whip on his waist and his muscles flexed
as he climbed out of the hole. His eyes locked onto Michael’s, and he snarled,
revealing rows of darkened teeth. “You are sentenced to spend an eternity in
Hell.” The voice barked a command and the first demon lashed out with his whip.
Michael screamed as its barbs sunk into his flesh, tearing his skin as it wound
around him. The demon wielding it laughed as his counterpart sprung forward. Reaching
the edge of the tear, his arm burst through, releasing a deafening shrill.
Michael screamed again and thrashed violently against his restraints. The whip
got tighter, and the barbs went deeper as they lacerated flesh and muscle,
scratching bone and ripping tendons and blood vessels apart. The demon pulled
itself out, towering over Michael, he tilted his head, studying Michael with a
sneer before picking him up and tossing him into the tear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“Welcome
Michael,” Michael’s eyes snapped open in the darkness and he moved his head
from side to side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“Apologies,”
the voice that had woken him said. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Michael
heard wheels rolling, then he felt a scaled hand briefly touch his face. An unnatural
yellow glow tinted with red broke the darkness. Michael blinked at the sudden change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“Is
that better?” The voice asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Michael
turned towards the sound of the voice, wondering who would show him, or anyone,
kindness in hell. He felt his heart stop, then it resumes, thundering against
his chest as it threatened to leap out at any moment. Opposite him, wearing a
lopsided crown made of bones was a demon. He smiled, revealing canine-like
teeth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“How
was your trip?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Michael
tried to stand and felt a sharp pain across his body. He looked down and saw
the same barbed whip kept him tied to the chair. Trembling, he returned his
gaze to the demon. “W—what do you want with me?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>“I’m
sure you know where you are.” The demon gestured around himself. “so, you know
what’s at stake here.” Michael could only nod, swallowing a lump that formed in
his throat. The demon nodded, “Good. With that out of the way, I’m Abaddon, and
I’m here,” he paused and slid a slip of paper forward, “to offer you a job.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Michael
blinked, “Come again?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>Abaddon
raised his hand, “No thanks,” he reached under his desk and grabbed a small
dagger, “already had a session with Lilith.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            Michael
flinched as the knife hit the table. After nothing happened after a few
seconds, he opened his eyes and saw Abaddon staring at him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            “It’s a
joke, calm down.” He leaned back and sighed, “look, Michael, you’re in Hell, and
there’s no need to act surprised that you’re here after what you did. But I
can’t help you if you don’t work with me. So,” He slid the slip of paper closer
to Michael, “work with me.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            Michael’s
eyes slowly traveled to the paper in front of him. “Contract for hire?” He
looked up at Abaddon and back to the paper. “What is this?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            “You can read,
can’t you?” When Michael realized that Abaddon was waiting for a response, he
nodded, “Good. Give it a closer look. I’m sure you’ll agree to the terms.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            The whip
disappeared and Michael tested his limbs and winced in anticipation of
excruciating pain and was surprised when he found none. He let out a breath and
reached for the paper, half expecting it to be a joke. When nothing happened,
he brought it closer and started reading. He frowned. “Seventeen twenty an
hour?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            Abaddon
nodded his head, “Yeah, that’s your starting salary. Is there a problem?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            Michael
scanned the paper again, mumbling to himself, then aloud he said. “What if I
refuse?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            “You’ll
be transported to another company within Hell and given a different contract
with less pay. Refuse again and the process repeats itself. If you make the
mistake of not accepting, you’ll end up being tortured before being sent to do
menial labor, which includes joining Hell’s army.” Abaddon picked up the knife
and held it out for Michael. “So, you can sign, and start working for me or decline
and join another company. I can tell you; the others don’t have the same
benefits as I do.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            Michael
frowned again, willing the numbers to change. “Fine,” He placed the paper on
the table and reached over for the knife, “I’ll sign it.”</span></p>
