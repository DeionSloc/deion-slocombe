<h1>Izora</h1>

<p>
    
    The Goddess of beauty peace, and fertility, she started as the most reluctant of Inzoa's Envoys to bring her down, but after her apotheosis, her doubts were washed away as she reveled in her power and station. She surrounds herself with opulence and despite her title, advocates for Inzoa's beheading in her weakened state.
