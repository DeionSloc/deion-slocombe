        The Goddess of the Underworld, originally the first God, she was betrayed by her envoys, Akuji, Akoth, Izora and their ringleader, Narroth. When she was overthrown, they used the magic she taught them, and used it to siphon her power into themselves. Now trapped with Akuji as her 'husband' she's driven by revenge. Her title as Goddess of the Underworld has no meaning, but, she is allowed to tell stories to the souls that inhabit the plane, serving as a mother and guiding hand.
