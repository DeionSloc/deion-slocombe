<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Oh this is a banger, bought a couple hangers
so I can stare at my banner,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Majestic perfection wrapped around an
impenetrable armor of imperfections,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Like I say I’m ancient and ain’t shit at a
glance,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But if you take a look at what lies beneath
you’ll find a nuanced core we call humanity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Confusing isn’t it? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>How we live for the moment but get bottled up
in minutes taken out of context, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And God forbid you try to tackle the
complexities without forewarning, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Are you with me or my enemy? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Are you a bro, a sis, do I gotta get the tool
just in case but before that let me take classes so I don’t miss the chance to
fix.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Are we on the same level, do we see eye to eye
or do I have to get my guys to assist you with your… education</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>From the looks of it you need rearranging,
listening to the opposition got your mind racing and changing its melody, its
tune, its proper thought process, but don’t worry, I can fix that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Piles of books written by yours truly, full of
our true history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And, remember, fuck the naysayers, they’re
just haters, they aint us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>What do they know? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Their stories are full of lies and
misdirections, least to mention blaspheming on the daily, but real quick yo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I’ll die for this shit and so should you, lone
band of brothers and sisters on top of a hill facing an eternal Sun armed with
guns that never run out of ammunition, cause there’s no safety, just automatic
fire and the roars of the righteous blotting out the sound that comes below…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>You hear crying?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>False advertisements from the enemy so don’t
heed what they say. Keep your eyes trained down the sights and that trigger
finger curled tight. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Don’t let up son, we got this in the bag,
mowing them like grass, their ashes will be fertilizer for the new garden of
our growing empire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This another banger from another angle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Tired from the climb up we scrape hands
against unforgiving rocks and the blood pools blow us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It’s just one big… stain on our history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Still, we lock eyes with our enemies and shoulder
on, firing bursts from closed eyes and tear marked faces, cheeks pinched and
with no replacements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>We’re the last and the banner I carry will
stand,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Atop a hill where we don’t belong, lording
over bodies of those that couldn’t get along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Crying out to God asking why were we made to
do this, but then, the sound of heretical guns break through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Was this a test from the Most high? Putting my
faith against the blasphemers that laugh as they slay His children gleefully. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I can see it in their eyes, and I ask
forgiveness for wavering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Lord on this day, grant me the strength to
carry out your mercy, and your word to the unfaithful that lay before me, let
these blessed bullets find their mark, and remove sin from this plane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>For through your mercy can we grant those that
rebel against your name the chance to repent.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The prayer lifts the spirit and it spreads
like wildfire, truth that His Word is true, so I don’t falter, I don’t waiver
when we reach the top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Screaming out encouragement through scripture,
I let the Lord and his angels guide me as I send these wayward souls up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>
