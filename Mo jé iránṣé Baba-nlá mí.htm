<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Impatience inflating to equal the Nation </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>(My man what you talking about? You's a
vagrant!)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>No, I'm actually sainted, knighted by the
Ancestors to pass on the knowledge, the truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's shocking but looking at it sideways won't
change the shape, looking at it through tainted glasses won't reveal the bitter
fruit that's beneath, but don't we need that bitterness to know that shit ain't
sweet? I mean we can't have victories without a shameful defeat, but then it
isn't a loss but a lesson that we pass to sisters and brethren to sever the
ties of incomplete recollection and let's not forget to mention the cup full of
reverence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Toast to the false reverends that led us here.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Deer in Lions clothing promising us an end to
the suffering, but its with the utmost sadness that they bring us to the cusp
of nothing gained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Tis in the water and I must say it's a jolly
good show old boy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But these waters we can't swim in, a bottle of
Sprite, Ginger Ale and seasoned meals for the healing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Blessed be the oppressors version of what
happened but these blessings from me are fake, like the modern God's we've
made. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Born from flesh, blood flowing with gold and
speaking with wine tapped tongues and fruit sealed lips, lean in too close and
become a witness to the bullshit. Anything else and its a full clip of
documents outlining one side of a multi-faceted story, even then the shoe don't
fit and its on the wrong foot, stepping into a groove you don't know but the
Wagon is clapping, the yams are healthy and that thang thanging. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Disgrace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This is my Grace, my story and my song and
you's a goofy if you try and sing along without first learning where I'm coming
from.</span></p>
